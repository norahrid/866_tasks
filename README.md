# 866_tasks

You are a software developer who has just joined a team that is developing HealthRecords, an application to digitally store the medical records of Narnia residents. Due to the sensitive data (e.g., private medical data, SINs) stored on HealthRecords, it is very important that you use secure coding practices. Failure to do so may result in vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious adversaries and potentially result in many far-reaching consequences for HealthRecords users.

Since you've just joined the team, you will start off by completing five tasks with a secure code plugin enabled. This plugin flags instances of secure code and helps you to address the detected security issue. The plugin will prevent you from continuing to code until you address the insecurity.
